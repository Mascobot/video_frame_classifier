# video_frame_classifier

The "Video Frame Classifer" is a simple local app to break videos into frames and to label them fast. 

I made the tool as I needed to do some quick labeling of some images out of very long videos to train some machine learning models.

You can run the script in you local machine by installing the libraries. Compiled apps for Windows and Linux are also included so that so that you don't need to install any dependencies.
